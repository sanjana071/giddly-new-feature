Prototype &amp; design for Giddly Group Planning + Event Voting feature
 Giddly – Group Planning & Real-Time Event Voting Feature

This repo contains my feature proposal and simple prototype for improving the Giddly experience.

Why this feature?
While using the app, I felt that even though Giddly shows events around me, there is no native way for a group of friends to decide together. People need to go back to WhatsApp to discuss.

This feature fixes that.
What the feature does
- Create a group
- Share events to the group
- Members vote: Yes / No / Maybe
- Group chat included
- Auto decide best event
- Add final event to calendar

 Prototype included
- UI mockups
- React Native demo components
- Firebase sample data
- Firebase rules

This prototype shows how voting and chatting will work inside Giddly.
